# /devcontainer

Target a devcontainer clone for command execution in this OpenCode session.

## Usage

```
/devcontainer [target]
```

## Arguments

- `target` - One of:
  - Empty: Show current status
  - `<branch>`: Target branch in current repo's clones
  - `<repo>/<branch>`: Target specific repo/branch
  - `off`: Disable devcontainer targeting

## Examples

```
/devcontainer              # Show current devcontainer status
/devcontainer feature-x    # Target feature-x branch clone
/devcontainer myapp/main   # Target main branch of myapp
/devcontainer off          # Disable, run commands on host
```

## Behavior

When a devcontainer is targeted:
- Most commands run inside the container automatically
- Git, file reading, and editors run on host
- Prefix with `HOST:` to force host execution

The plugin handles:
- Creating shallow clones for each branch
- Auto-assigning ports from configurable range (13000-13099)
- Starting/stopping devcontainers as needed
- Routing commands to the correct container
